# XGBoost

# Install xgboost following the instructions on this link: http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#

# Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/m00760171/Desktop/Templates/trunk/data/normal/data_OFF_OFF_OFF.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:, 0:41].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, 41].values


# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)

# Fitting XGBoost to the Training set
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
classifier = XGBClassifier()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predicting the Test set results
y_pred = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Making the Confusion Matrix
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

# Applying k-Fold Cross Validation
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
accuracies = cross_val_score(estimator = classifier, X = X_train, y = y_train, cv = 10)
accuracies.mean()
accuracies.std()
